> [!IMPORTANT]
> #### For Modders:
> Vanilla Engine has recently been updated to support the new FNF 0.3.x charts. For **backwards** compatibility for Charts, Inst, and Vocals, do the following:
> 1. In your week file, instead of weeks:generateNotes(chartfile, metafile, difficulty), call weeks:legacyGenerateNotes(chartfile)
> 2. Only load the vocals for VoicesBF. This is because VE now uses the FNNF 0.3.x Vocals system (split-vocal files).

Friday Night Funkin' Vanilla Engine is a rewrite of [Friday Night Funkin'](https://ninja-muffin24.itch.io/funkin) built on [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) for Windows and using [Funkin' Rewritten](https://github.com/HTV04/Funkin-Rewritten) as a base.

Friday Night Funkin' Rewritten features:
* A rewritten engine focused on performance and playability
* Much less memory usage than the original game
* Controller support
* Other cool features, like downscroll
* Extended support for more platforms (MacOS, Linux, Nintendo Switch, etc.)
* And more to come!
